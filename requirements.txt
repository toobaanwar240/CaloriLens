## **Key Changes:**

1. ✅ **Replace `opencv-python` with `opencv-python-headless`** - This is the critical fix! The headless version works on cloud environments without GUI dependencies.

2. ✅ **Added `python-dotenv`** - Your app uses `load_dotenv()` for API keys

3. ✅ **Added `huggingface-hub`** - Your app uses `hf_hub_download()` to download models

## **Additional Recommendations:**

If you still face issues, you might also want to add a `packages.txt` file in your repo root with system dependencies:

**packages.txt:**
```
libgl1-mesa-glx
libglib2.0-0
